# exercise 1 - star component

### Using Bootstap and its glyhicons -  create simple page with clickable Star icon.

#### Basic
- Create empty **index.html** file.
- Add Bootstrap to your page. Use **w3schools** to learn how to do that.
- Add **star icon** to your html code.
- Star should change its appearance from full-color to border-only when clicked.
- When hovering over the star, cursor should be changed to pointer, and icon should increase its size by 3%

#### Advanced
- Create account on **github**
- Create branch **exercise_1** in this repository (you need to be added as a contributor, by repo owner before that)
- Push your code to new created branch
- Create **PR** (*pull request*) to master branch with your changes.

##### Tips
- Use icons: 'glyphicon-star' and 'glyphicon-star-empty':
